## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

This project is from udacity self-driving car degree.The aim is to train a CNN model to recognize traffic signs.The training data are natural images of German traffic sign .It can be downloade at[German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

### Dependencies
1.Tensorflow 

2.scikit-learn 

### Dataset

1. [Download the dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/581faac4_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip). 

### Test result
Pick some pics in the test dataset and test the trained model on them.

There are 8 traffic sign pics.7 right.1 wrong.If do some data augumentation or add more epoches,the accuracy may improve a little.
